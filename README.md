This was my first real dive into Android development. I built a mobile app that helps people manage shared expenses in a group—like splitting bills or tracking who paid for what. It gave me a great intro to how Android apps work behind the scenes.

Here’s what I worked on:

Basics – Learned how Android apps are structured, including activities, XML layouts, and lifecycle events.

Navigation – Built multiple screens (like group creation, charge entry, and renaming) and connected them with intents for smooth transitions.

Models – Wrote Java classes like Group, Person, Item, and Money to manage the app’s data and logic.

Logic – Handled how expenses are added and split across group members, updating the right data along the way.

UI – Designed simple, clean forms using XML to collect user input and show group details.

Testing – Added unit tests to make sure the logic for things like splitting costs and renaming groups worked as expected.

This project helped me get comfortable building real Android apps—from front-end design to back-end logic. I walked away with a much better understanding of how to structure code, handle user input, and think through app features from both a developer and user perspective.
